For a long time she was also grown there. The word \"Cayenne\" derives from the language of the natives in this area and means something like \"hot pepper\". The fruits are characterized by a biting / pungent sharpness with a slightly smoky aroma. The Cayenne is known to most but probably more through the widely available cayenne pepper. But also in medicine Cayenne is used. Cayenne pepper extract is the main component of heat pots and heat ointments. The active ingredient here is capsaicin, which stimulates blood circulation at the affected site and thus promotes healing. Meanwhile, capsaicin is increasingly being obtained from varieties with a higher capsaicin concentration, e.g. Red Savina or Bhut Jolokia. Own experiences: The cayenne have grown magnificently with us, both in the field, as well as pot culture. The plants form many branches, are medium sized and have many long thin fruits. The only difference is that they grow even bushier in the field.
